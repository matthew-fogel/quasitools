Quasitools is a collection of tools for analysing viral quasispecies data. The following tools are currently available in quasitools:

* **[aacoverage](aacoverage.md)**: builds an amino acid consensus and returns its coverage
* **[call](call.md)**: contains tools for identifying variants between a NGS dataset and a fasta reference sequence
* **[complexity](complexity.md)**: reports the complexity of a quasispecies using several measures
* **[consensus](consensus.md)**: generate a consensus sequence from a BAM file
* **[distance](distance.md)**: measures the distance between quasispecies using angular cosine distance
* **[dnds](dnds.md)**: calculates the dn/ds value for each region in a bed file
* **[drmutations](drmutations.md)**: identifies amino acid mutations
* **[hydra](hydra.md)**: identify HIV drug resistance mutations in an NGS dataset
* **[quality](quality.md)**: perform quality control on FASTQ reads

# Release

__quasitools 0.6.0__

This release improves the documentation, integrates PyAAVF, and fixes a bug in quasitools distance that sometimes caused the software to crash.
